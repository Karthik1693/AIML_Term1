Mr. David Smith is looking for some help in understanding how clustering techniques are used for a K-means Model using the cancer.csv dataset 

 the dataset contains the following:

Independent Variables:

id: id number 
Clump Thickness: 1 - 10 
Uniformity of Cell Size: 1 - 10 
Uniformity of Cell Shape: 1 - 10 
Marginal Adhesion: 1 - 10 
Single Epithelial Cell Size: 1 - 10 
Bare Nuclei: 1 - 10 
Bland Chromatin: 1 - 10 
Normal Nucleoli: 1 - 10 
Mitoses: 1 - 10 
Dependent Variable:

Class: (2 for benign, 4 for malignant)

 

Note: Please drop the “id” column prior to analysis (see Week4b example for code)

 

The Ask:

 

In a PPT presentation please provide the following:
 

            a)    Cover Page (Title, First and Last Name, Student Number)

            b)   Description of what analysis you will be conducting

            c)    Identify the number of clusters required to optimize a K-means Model by using both the Elbow and Silhouette Methods.

           d)   Identify two(2) insights from the newly created clusters
