K means clustering

K Means Clustering :
-> Comes under unsupervised learning.
-> Identify the number of cluster we want which is K Value or Centroid.(Elbow method - Find wess value which shows minimum change)
-> Randomnly select K data points.
-> Measure the distance between data points and the K values,group them into clusters based on the distance(use Eucledian distance),then find the mean.
-> Change the K value to mean and cluster again until group doesnt change after changing K value with mean,
